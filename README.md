# Outlier-Analysis
This project focuses on demonstrating the different methods of Outlier identification in a data set using Python code and also how to treat them in order to avoid underperforming Machine Learning models.

Malcolm Gladwell in his best-selling book **Outliers: The Story of Success** defined Outliers as “something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body”. In the field of Data Science, **Outliers (also known as Anomalies)** are defined as an observation or sets of observations that are inconsistent with the remainder of the dataset. This inconsistency is usually visible in the relative distance of outliers from other points on a multi-dimensional space of features.

The study of Outliers in Data Science is important because they highlight critical incidents such as; technical glitches, significant events, human error, or behavioral change which helps in better understanding the phenomenon being studied. They also affect the learning process of Machine Learning algorithms, which often reduces model performance and accuracy of predictions.

There are 3 main types of Outliers:

* **I: Point (Global) Outliers** - a single data point that significantly differs from other points in the dataset e.g. credit card transaction of 2000USD from a customer whose previous maximum spend was 100USD

* **II: Contextual Outliers** - Outliers in this category are commonly found in time series data. They are data point(s) that is/are significantly different from the dataset, but only within a specific context. The context might be seasonal fluctuations or wider economic trends. e.g. sales surge on Black Friday

* **III: Collective Outliers** - a series of data points that deviates significantly from the entire dataset e.g. residents of a neighborhood all moving out at the same time.
